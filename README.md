# DataScienceProjects
Here are my some data science projects I worked on using Jupyter Notebook and Python.
All the files of the "ipynb" type so they only be viewed on appropriate programs such as Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Notebook viewer or Google Colab.

For the code to work the python requirements must be installed on your computer. To install the requirements you will need pip and python version 3.
Then open a command terminal, go to the repository folder and run the command: pip install -r requirements.txt.
